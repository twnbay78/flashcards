  question: "What are the definitions of the following terms: transom, tiller, skag, telltale?",
  answer: `transom: the vertical metal plate installed at the stern of the vessel for outboard motor installations
tiller: The horizontal rod attached to an outboard engine that gets shifted horizontally to turn the direction of the entire outboard motor, thus changing the vector of propulsion force and thus steering the vessel. This can be done manually on smaller vessels or done via a steering wheel on a larger vessel. 
skag: the bottom metal plate below the prop
telltale: the hole in the engine where you should see water is coming out of to ensure it's pumping properly.`,
