## Before Getting Boat Underway

### Side of boat

<img src="./images/boat_parts.jpg"></img>

#### Terms

- bow: front of vessel
- stern: rear of vessel 
- port: left of vessel
- starboard: right of vessel
- cleat: metal fitting on which rope can be fastened
- hull: body of the boat
- gunwale: boat's upper side edge
- propeller: propulsion device attached to the engine producing acceleration
- all-round white light: light on the vessel that is all round, white, usually elevated, required on all vessels?
- red and green sidelights: lights on the front of the vessel that are red and green and one on each side
- bowstop: tip of the boat

### Front of Boat

<img src="./images/boat-parts-front.jpg"></img>

#### Terms

- beam: max width of the vessel
- freeboard: the distance between the water and the maximum height of the boat
- keel: The portion of the hull that is the main centeraline or the extension of the hull that gives the boat more stability
- draft: the minumum depth of water required to float a boat

### Hulls

There are two types of hulls: displacement and planning

#### Displacement Hulls

Displacement hulls are designed to cut through the water and move the water aside, requiring less propulsion. 

The weight of the displaced water should be equal to the weight of the boat
- Physics check on that? 
- requires symetry right?
- doesn't count persons or objects on the boat?

Sailboats and large cruisers have displacement hulls, allowing travel through water more smoothly.

#### Planing Hulls

Planing hulls are designed to rise above the water and glide accross it, allowing for higher speeds. 

Most planning hulls are flat or vee shaped. 

Most motorboats, personal watercraft (PWC) and small sailboats have planning hulls.

Planing hulls will also displace water at low speeds or at rest.

<img src="./images/mode_displacement.jpg"></img>

Your planing boat hull enteres plowing mode when the bow of the boat rises high above your line of sight and obstructs vision. Careful driving, proper acceleration and speed management should prevent plowing mode. Reaching this mode presumably depends on the type of boat, the speed, the acceleration, weight of the boat, etc...

<img src="./images/mode_plowing.jpg"></img>

Your boat with a planing hull enters planing mode when the hull rises above the water line and is propelling forward with the inboard water jet. Reaching this mode presumably depends on the type of boat, the speed, the acceleration, weight of the boat, etc...

#### Terms

- PWC: personal watercraft. A small vessel which requires a person or persons to operate on the vessel rather than inside and uses an inboard jet drive as a primary mechanism of propulsion. 

### Boat Length

A boat's length is measuresd from bow to stern, not including any bowstrings, rudders, outboard motors, handles or attachments.

<img src="./images/vessel_length.jpg"></img>
<img src="./images/vessel_length_pwc.jpg"></img>

There are different classes of length which are no longer recognized by the coast guard

        <td>40 ft to 64 ft</td>
    </tr>
</table>

#### Terms

- rudder: steering device; usually a metal plate installed vertically at the stern of the vessel

### Engines and Drives

#### Outboard Engines

Outboard engines are self-contained engines that get installed on the transom of the boat. 

Newer outboard motors are either newly designed two stroke motors that have around 75% better fuel efficiency or four stroke motors compared to the traditional two-stroke system. 

A four stroke motor is comprised of 4 stages: intake, compression, ignition and exhaust. The crankshaft will rotate once during intake, where the pistok will expand and fuel enters the cylinder. The crankshaft will finish it's rotation, compressing the intaked fuel witin the cylinder. Then, ignition will occur, to which the crankshaft rotates again and the piston expands, combusting the fuel and translating the chemical energy into mechanical. Lastly, the crankshaft rotates, expanding the pisoton as the cylinder empties it's byproducts of the combustion cycle out towards the ressonator/muffler. 


<img src="./images/4_Stroke_Sequence_600px.jpg"></img>

A two stroke engine will have shafts along it's crankshaft where fuel is injected and in one revolution/2 piston cycles, the fuel will be intaked and ignited, and them compressed and exhausted out. This produces more power under identical cylinder sizes, allowing for smaller applicatoins, and are easier to start in cold condutions, and are cheaper but isn't as fuel efficient or durable.

Steering the outboard motor is done by the tiller, which is attached to the steering wheel of the vessel usually. 

#### Inboard Engines

Inboard engines are automotive engines installed in the midsection of the hull or right behind the transom and are four-stroke engines. PWCs usually have two-stroke inboard engines. 

The driveshaft usually runs along the engine to the propeller in the stern, and there is a rudder behind the propellor used for stearing. 

Newer inboard PWC engines also have more fuel efficient direct-injection designs. 

<img src="./images/engine_type_inboard.jpg"></img>

#### Sten Drives

Stern drives, also called inboard/outboard engines, combine elements from both inboard and outboard engines.

Inboard qualities:
- Stern drive engines are installed inside the hull, through the transom to a drive unit or an outdrive
- Stern drive engines are four stroke automobile engines
- These engines are quieter and more fuel efficient

The engine is attached to the outdrive through a drive shaft, and that controls the propellor and the outdrive swivels like an outboard engine. 


#### Jet Drives

Jet drives differ in steering and propulsion. Instead of a propeller, there is an impeller, which is an engine-powered water pump that sucks in water under pressure through the bottom of the vessel and propels it outward in the rear. The direction of the water propulsion out the stern determines the direction of stearing. 

There can be an inboard version of this too, where the impeller is located inside the vessel, and there is an intake grate on the side to pull the water into the impeller and blocking large debris. 

These types of engines are good in shallow water conditions. 

<img src="./images/jet-drives-labeled.jpg"></img>

#### Terms

- transom: the vertical metal plate installed at the stern of the vessel for outboard motor installations
- tiller: The horizontal rod attached to an outboard engine that gets shifted horizontally to turn the direction of the entire outboard motor, thus changing the vector of propulsion force and thus steering the vessel. This can be done manually on smaller vessels or done via a steering wheel on a larger vessel. 
- skag: the bottom metal plate below the prop
- telltale: the hole in the engine where you should see water is coming out of to ensure it's pumping properly.

### PWC

Any inboard vessel that's less than 16ft. 

<img src="./images/pwc-oblique-view.png"></img>
<img src="./images/pwc-side-view-labeled.jpg"></img>

#### Terms

- safety lanyard: a lanyard that attaches the engine control cutoff switch (ECOS) to the  wrist of the operator or PFD (personal flotation device)
- steering control: the handles for steering
- throrttle lever: lever located right below the right steering control handle to throttle engine
- drive shaft: the long stem that connects the engine to the impeller
- steering nozzle: the nozzle directing the water from the jet drive stream out the stern of the boat, steering it based on it's angle

### Sailboat 

<img src="./images/pwc-side-view-labeled.jpg"></img>

#### Terms

- Halyards: Lines used to lower/raise sails
- sheets: used to control angle to the sails and the wind

### Capacity Plate

The boat's capacity plate contains the number of passengers that can safely be aboard the vessel and/or the maximum weight supported (including engine, attachments, gear, persons, etc...). The capacity plate may also contain non-gear weight as well as the max horsepower rating for the vessel. PWCs and sailboats do not need to abide by this requirement.

All boats less than 20ft must have this capacity plate as per NJSP, but according to a federal org (National Marine Manfufacturers Association, NMMA), all boats 26ft or less must have this plate. 

If there is no capacity plate, you can estimate the max # of persons that can safely board the vessel based on the following equation:

Max # of passengers = area ft^2 / 15 = length_ft * width_ft / 15

Boats that do not abide by capacity plate requirements have a higher risk of swamping or capsizing. 

<img src="./images/maximum_capacity_plate.jpg"></img>

#### Terms

- swamping: boat filling up with water
- capsizing: boat flipping

### Float plans

Float plans should be created before any type (short or long) trip starts and sent to someone (friend, family, marina, coast guard, NJSP) before-hand. The person then should be contacted after the trip concludes, so they know to alert NJSP if you do not alert them in time. The float plan could include:

- The name of your vessel
- The registration of your vessel 
- The make, model, type, engine type, color, engine horsepower, and other identifying elements of your vessel
- The destinations of the trip
- The timings of the trip
- All of the passengers who would be on board
- Phone numbers of NJSP / Coast guard who to contact
- Description of trailer and automobile, including license plate
- Survival/Communications gear manifest

### Fueling the boat

#### Before Fueling Checklist

1. Get everyone off of the boat
2. Turn off any electronics
3. Turn off gas burners or pilot light
4. Close doors and windows to prevent fumes from entering the vessel
5. Ensure the fuel lines and connections are all attached properly and are in good order
6. Ensure no one is smoking or lighting matches/lighters on dock
7. Remove portable fuel tanks
8. Make sure fire extinguisher is in close reach
9. Tie the boat down to securely to the fuel dock

#### While fueling your boat checklist

1. Ensure the fuel nozzle is fully in the gas cap and hold steady to give it static spark
2. Ensure no water gets through the water or bilge
3. Wipe up spilled fuel and dispose of rags/paper towels properly
4. Use caution to fill slowly and leave some room in the tank

#### After fueling boat checklist

1. Open doors and windows to ventalate fumes
2. Smell fumes in engine compartment and bilge and keep ventilating until there are no more odors, don't turn on until odors clear. Potentially get a vapor detection system. Fumes are heavier than air and settle at the bottom in enclosed areas.
3. Fully fasten gas cap
4. Turn on exhaust blower/power ventalation system for 4 min before turning on engine if boat is equipped with one
5. Start engine and reload passengers

#### Fueling PWC checklist

1. Do not tip the PWC to get more fuel, there must be space left in the tank
2. Ensure fuel nozzle is firmly in place
3. Wipe off any oils left
4. Avoid spills in water
5. Check everything for leaks, including fuel lines and connections
6. Open door to engine compartment and smell for gas/fumes, and ventilate fully before starting the engine.

- For intercoastal waters, yellow triangle means pass port side, yellow square means pass starboard
- For buoys indicating channel splits, red on green means pass it on your starboard side, green on red means pass it on port side
- black and white stripes means stay away from shore
- crossed orange diamond means there are hazards around
- non-crossed orange diamond means there are hazards inside such as rocks
- circle means controlled area: low speed, no fishing/anchoring, skiing, slow no wake, no prop boats
- square means information
- Striped buoy means mid-channel, pass on either side

### Locks, dams, and bridges

- You must wait 400ft way from a lock for the flashing signal to enter the lock
- Respond with one prolonged horn blast and one short one (i.e. for motorboat response ok signals)
- lock lights:
    - red means stay clear and dont enter
    - amber means approach slowly
    - green means enter
- Have fenders and 100ft of rope 

#### Terms
- aground: touching the ground

### Water levels
- Tides are created by sun and moon exerting pull on thearth
- High and low tides occur in 6 hour intervals

### PWC
Before going out
- Commit owners manual to memory, read it
- use type I PFDs
- Review PWC manufacturer video
- Be aware of local, state and federal laws that apply to a PWC
- You must have a whistle, fire extinguisher, flag and paddle before heading out
- Must check the signaling before heading out
- Must attach ignition switch safety lanyard to PFD, ensure ECOS works properly and is installed
- Inspect PWC, maintenance it regularly, and keep it in good operating condigion
- Be aware of local, state and federal PWC laws
- Children who can't put both feet on footrests and hold onto the other person should not ride
- Wear wetsuit and protection as jets can injure you
- Don't exceed max weight capacity
- Know your own limits

While riding:
- Most modern PWCs have assisted steering and braking
- Give plenty of room to stop, even with assisted braking
- Keep away from the steering nozzle, as you can get caught in engines
- PWCs must be powered to steer as they have no rudder
- Never use reverse to stop a PWC or people could get flung off
- Do not ride closely to other PWCs or boats, it causes blind spots
- Always look around you before making turns, and Be aware of all traffic, not just ahead
- Do not make quick turns
- Always hold onto the other person fully while keeping feet on footrests
- if capsized, look for decal that shows which way to roll PWC or check owners manual
- Reduce noise by not going by campers, not traveling in groups, not lingering in the same spot
- Do not ride wake or intentionally wake others
- Make sure water is at least 30 inches deep
- Don't create wake near shores
- Dont' operate at very low speeds
- Do not dock in grass


After riding:
- Shut off engine and clear pump after riding

### Propeller Strike Safety and boat safety on water

- Turn off engine when people are boarding/offboarding or when people are in the water behind the boat
- Never start boat with engine in gear
- Never ride on a seat back, gunwale, transom or bow
- Make sure all passengers are seated proeprly before getting underway
- Assign responsibule adult ot watch children and the boat, sound alarm if child falls
- Maintain properly lookout
- Slowdown during congestion and anchorages
- Recognize warning byoys and mark swimming and other hazardous areas
- Keep boat away from swimming areas
- **Look for red flag with white diagonal stripe and blue/white alfa flag (must be used on federal waters) signaling that divers are down**
- Ensure propeller strike equipment is installed:
    - Guards that form a physical barrier
        - Deflection devices, cages, ring guards, ringed props, kort nozzles
    - Jet drives and pump jets
    - Interlocks: devicses that automatically turn off engine or sound alarm
    - ladder interlock
    - Sensors: work by boaters that shut off engine or trigger alarm
- NEVER let go from steering wheel, avoiding circle of death: let go of steering wheel, wheel cuts left flinging you off, boat travels in circle to come around and kill you
- You may not travel at a high rate of speed within 200ft of a pier, marina, dock, or wharf
