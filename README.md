# flashcards
A simple flashcard app, initially developed by ChatGPT using the GPT4o model. 

I was studying for my boating exam and came to the point where I needed a way to study my 2k+ lines of notes that I had taken from 8 hours worth of coursework. After a few minutes of just skimming through the notes, I thought I wasn't getting anything out of that method and instead wanted to use flashcards. But I was unimpressed with the flashcards online, and thought I'd use chatGPT to create flashcards. 

Nonetheless, i was even more frustrated with the flashcards that were produced. So I thought, what if I could get it to generate flashcards from my notes? I estimated that it would take me about 2-3 hours to create flashcards from my notes, and that it would probably only take chatGPT about 5-15 minutes of prompting. And thus I got chatGPT to take my notes and translate them into a series of questions and answers. However, I still didn't have flashcards. i just had notes, in a different format. 

I thought to myself, how long would it take me to make a flashcard app that would read all of the data produced by chatGPT? Probably a few hours. Not something I wanted to sink a few hours into when i could probably just download a flashcard app that accepts csv data and prompt chatGPT to get the text formatted into the CSV format the app wanted. 

So finally I decided to experiment and see how quickly chatGPT could actually build me a Flashcard web app. Even if I sunk 30 minutes into prompting and didn't get much out of it, I still would have:

- Finally gotten chatGPT to build me a full app, something I haven't done thus far because I am skeptical on relying on chatGPT too heavily for broad tasks that have any consequence at all
- Tested the limitations of chatGPT in terms of web development
- Actually gotten some use out of the data chatGPT gave me better studied for my exam

So in 30 minutes, I got chatGPT to build me a flashcard webapp. It was very ugly. There were so many bugs, at points I just intervened and fixed them. Additionally, the data it gave was horrible at points. After 30 minutes, around 15-20 prompts, I finally got to a state where it was semi-useful. It totally crapped the bed on the backend portion so I had it basically use static files to store all of the data. 

Let this be a history marker for how well chatGPT functions roughly 1.5 years after it's wide-found success. Our developer jobs are safe for the time being. Let this also stand for a study guide for boaters in the US looking to get their boating license.
